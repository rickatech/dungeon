for dungeon

grep FUTURE in code enahncement suggestions

Use Cases - handy for smoke testing before release
  - fresh install, make sure home and dungeon maps establish okay when logged
    in player starts to play
      - new player, create home map
      - new player, enter dungeon, move around, return to home map
  - inconsistent map state
    if more than two players are moving on same map simultaneously, player
    writes will force their latest position, (should not revert other player position)
      - FUTURE: start tracking tick/player/map?  .. consider using flock?
  - backups
    need daily static file backups!  build into normal activity?

Ideas (no particular order)
  - user mananager, CRUD for user admin
    some form of limited self signup (random dungeon, get to the end)
  - basic level editor
  - stategic vs action maps
    strategic map forces strict turn based play, though troll player could
    lock a strategic map by entering and not moving?  active players could
    vote to kick (mark as left) a troll player
    action map is essential FIFO action based (w/minimal flood/flock control)
  - javascript client side 'local map' + dynamic view refresh
    (mostly independent of actions menu, perhaps use target selected session)
      - view / mini-map / target/actions / chat
  - map doormat locations, a way to dedicate certain map space to spawning
    players to appear upon entering map.  Ideally multiple doormats
    for hanlding different entrances.  If all doormat space occupied,
    player enter will fail (entrance obstructed)
  - chat
    global, map, player to player (which may benefit from friend lists too)
  - debug map is rotated, how to make it so vi edit,
    debug output are right x / down y increasing
  - security levels for different maps
    map    sec 10, if innactive just stay put (home map)
           sec  9, if innactive, minor bounty to return you to home map
    player sec 10, no unsolicted harm to other players or NPC's
           sec  9, < 2 unsolited acts of aggresssion, +1 wander unfriendly NPC's        
aggresor bount tax, any character accrues bounty upon entering a new map if
their player secuirty level is less that that of the map level.
  - bounty is decreased if player is defeated by NPC or other charavter

  - 
forts (player created maps?)
  - 
groups/gangs/guilds/...
  - ...

defeated
  - returned 1 map closer to home map, or home map

bounty karma, how much bounty a char has collected or caused
faction currency, related to char home map region
  - certain advanced char can create new regions/currency
  - currency conversion between regions is NOT 1:1, inflation?

gametable play mode
  - reports generated to allow Dungeon Master and characers printouts
    basic rules, and even online DM assist to complete, or work thorugh a map
  - campaign paper form to record player progress made, dungeon new state
    includes a online, freeze map, gametable queue funciton to
    insure only gametable play is allowed until online play is enabled

background time
  - a php driven cron will run (every 5 minutes launch, but will sleep every
    20 secs and rerun ... 15 runs), will always check a lock file
    the cron will relaunch every 5 minutes
      - background dungeon/map cleanup
      - NPC activity
      - FUTURE: player 'retreat'scripts, minion actions
      - contract experation
